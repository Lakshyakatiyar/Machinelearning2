    "1=Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model learns the training data too well, capturing noise and random fluctuations instead of underlying patterns. As a result, the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "Consequences: The model's accuracy on the training data is high, but its generalization to new data is poor. It might fail to make accurate predictions in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "Mitigation: Techniques to mitigate overfitting include using more training data, reducing model complexity (e.g., using simpler algorithms or shallower neural networks), applying regularization (like L2 regularization), and using techniques like cross-validation to evaluate model performance on different subsets of data.\n",

    "Regularization is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and random fluctuations, which leads to poor generalization to new data. Regularization methods introduce additional constraints or penalties to the model's learning process, discouraging it from becoming overly complex and capturing noise. The goal is to find the right balance between fitting the data well and avoiding overfitting.\n",

    "L1 Regularization (Lasso):\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the model's coefficients to the loss function.\n",

    "L2 Regularization (Ridge):\n",
    "\n",
    "L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the squared values of the model's coefficients to the loss function.\n",
    "The penalty discourages large coefficients, leading to a more balanced impact of all features. It helps prevent extreme values and reduces the model's sensitivity to individual data points.\n",

    "Dropout (Neural Networks):\n",
    "\n",
    "Dropout is a regularization technique specific to neural networks. During training, randomly selected neurons are \"dropped out\" (i.e., their outputs are set to zero) with a certain probability.\n",
    "This prevents individual neurons from becoming overly specialized, leading to a more robust and generalized network.\n",
    "Early Stopping:\n",

    "Regularization techniques work by adding penalty terms to the model's loss function during training. These penalty terms modify the optimization process, encouraging the model to prioritize simplicity and generalize better. L1 regularization, for instance, tends to lead to sparse coefficient values (many coefficients become exactly zero), effectively selecting only the most important features. L2 regularization reduces the magnitude of coefficients, making them less sensitive to individual data points."
